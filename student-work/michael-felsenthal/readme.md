I recently completed a comprehensive technical and marketing communications course in Our Best Words (OBW).

My goal is to pivot into a career in technical or marketing communications.

I am someone who is always committed to the task at hand, and will always meet deadlines.  I also go above and beyond to make sure that the job is done correctly.
